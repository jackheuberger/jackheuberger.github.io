# Hi!

You probably just got here from BHSJobs. If you didn't, I'm proud of you for finding this place. 

If you're interested in supporting this site and my future work, feel free to click [here](https://buymeacoff.ee/jackheuberger). 

With enough support, I'll be able to reach the goals below:

## Goals for BHSJobs:
- Host on Google Cloud or AWS
- Buy a domain
- Expand to neighboring towns like Newton

Anything you could chip in would be greatly appreciated. If not, no worries. You're already super cool for using my site.


This tiny site was built with [StrapdownJS](http://strapdownjs.com). It's also super cool, just like you.
